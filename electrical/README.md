## Folder Structure

### 1. `cad_design`

**Purpose:**
The `cad_design` folder contains CAD files related to the circuity. This mainly includes housing for these circuits.

**Contents:**

- Solidwork files for PSU
- PCB box files

**Usage:**

1. Any CAD files should be placed here
2. 3D printing files, like GCODE can also go here

### 2. `documentation`

**Purpose:**
The `documentation` folder contains documentation on the entire design process for the electronic side of things.

**Contents:**

- Documentation on processes
- Images of said processes

**Usage:**

1. Store important information on the workings of the fabrication process
2. Any information on recreating the project

### 3. `schematic`

**Purpose:**
The `schematic` folder is dedicated to the electronic schematics for PCB design.

**Contents:**

- Circuit diagrams and schematics.
- Datasheets and reference materials for components.

**Usage:**

1. Add circuit diagrams and schematics for the project.
2. Store relevant datasheets and reference materials for easy access.
