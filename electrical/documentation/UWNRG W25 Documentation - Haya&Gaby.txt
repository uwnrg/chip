End of term documentation

Haya Dakhil & Gaby (most tasks were done together)

U-bracket Mount Machining 
Done by: Haya, Gaby with the help of Joshua
* Drilled holes in the U-bracket 
* As of right now, we are working on the work order to be completed so the brackets can be bent
Attachments: 
* ZStepperHolderDrawing.jpg - Preliminary 2D sketch in SOLIDWORKS, uploaded as JPG
* ZStepperHolderPart.png - Snapshot of machined part
Tools used: SOLIDWORKS, UW E5 Machine shop


Dimensioning of PSU, Circuit board, Screen
Done by: Haya
* Measured dimensions of the PSU including hole placements, the screen, and the control board. 
* These measurements were used for CAD and assembly planning. 
* Measured in inches
Attachments:
* Dimensions.pdf  - measurements and its diagrams
CAD Design and Printing - PSU Box
Done by: Haya

* Designed the PSU enclosure, which includes two parts:
   * Base, with a wire slot
   * A slide-in lid
During testing, I had to file down the top part of the base slightly for the PSU to fit through 
Attachments: 
* PSU_LID.SLDPRT
* PSU_BODY.SLDPRT
* PSUCasePhoto.png
Tools: SOLIDWORKS, 3D printer from RPC

Preliminary Sketch - Fluid Deposition Mechanism
Done by: Haya and Gaby
* Created a mechanism for fluid deposition for the screen-printing process. 
* The design was based on constraints to use a syringe and stepper motor
* Components can be CADded, but need to be screwed together
* Next steps: Create a schematic drawing and CAD parts surrounding the dimensions of our syringe and stepper motor 
Attachments:
* FluidIntegration.png file explaining the concept, and its components needed

PCB assembly and wiring
Done by: Haya and Gaby
* Most of the PCB work was done by Andrew, but we finalized it by doing its final connections of male and female connector wires. 
* We followed the documentation in a link Iâ€™ll provide.  
* An issue came up where the Z-axis connection didn't fit, so Andrew soldered the wires directly. 
Attachments: 
* PCBAssembly.png Snapshot showing the assembly

Electrical components - PSU/Components assembly
Done by: Haya, Gaby, Ahyan. Dany
* Helped attach electrical components to the PSU and tested wire connections.  
* We submitted a photo of this, though note: the wires have been continuously connected and disconnected due to ongoing testing 
Attachments:
* ComponentsAssembly.png


Education Liaison
Done by: Haya
* Acted as the Education Liaison for the team. My role was to support the Education sub-team by helping them understand the technical aspects of the project.  
* I connected with them to clarify details about the mechanical and electrical subsystems and answered any questions they had so they could complete their documentation accurately.
* We only had time to mainly discuss the chemical side of the curriculum
